# Portfolio Project by Dominik L.

## Welcome!

My name is Dominik and welcome to my personal portfolio project. As I grew up, I learned that I have taken quite a liking to technology in general, and wanted to learn deeper about it. Because of this, I felt that it would only be logical for me to take AP Computer Science Principles. While I was familiar with the concepts of loops, conditions, if and else statements, and more, this class has helped me solidify my knowledge on all these topics.

## My Project

Everything within this project was created using the knowledge that I, and other collaborators, learned over the course of this school year. I've learned different forms of tags in HTML such as span and div tags, as well as styling through the use of CSS, and the coding aspect, being JavaScript.

## Featured Projects

### Red Light Green Light

This is a simple game of Red Light Green Light. Your goal is to reach the black line, but moving while the light is red will result in a game over!

### Hangman

Hangman is a game where you guess a word by the letters that are used. But if you guess too many letters wrong, you are dead, so guess your letters wisely!

### Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is one of the simplest games you can play anywhere. You want to play against another person, with one of you as either X or O, and your goal is to see who can reach 3 characters in a row either diagonally, or straight.
